# Repository In-Silico-Pace-Mapping
contains all necessary modules and functions to generate ecg-based or egm-based pace-maps given a reference ecg/egm signal (which needs to be provided by the user if the repository is downloaded) and paced beat ecg/egm signals (which again needs to be provided by the user).


# Repository Automated_VT_Localisation
contains all necessary modules and functions to train/test a DL-based AI architecture to localise scar-related VT exit sites or locations of focal beats. Training and testing datasets (in .mat format) need to be provided by the user.

# Repository PhD_Important_Functions#
contains modules and functions to process, manipulate data, parametrise EP according to measured QRS/ECG signals, generate virtual scar around a mesh of interest and so on.
